            <h1>Corporate And Commercial Law</h1>
            <p>
                <h2>Registration of Companies:</h2>
                o Company registration is a crucial step for any business. It involves legally establishing a corporate
                entity. This process ensures compliance with local laws, provides a unique corporate identity, and
                allows the company to operate with legal recognition.

                <h2>Registration of Partnership Companies, Wholly Owned Subsidiary Companies, and Joint Venture
                    Companies:</h2>
                o Different business structures require specific registrations:
                 Partnership Companies: Registering partnerships clarifies ownership, responsibilities, and
                profit-sharing among partners.
                 Wholly Owned Subsidiary Companies: These are fully owned by another company (the parent company).
                Registration formalities vary based on local laws.
                 Joint Venture Companies: Collaboration between two or more entities for a specific project or business
                venture. Registration ensures legal validity.

                <h2>Import-Export Code Registration:</h2>

                facilitates customs clearance.

                o Crafting legally sound agreements for business partnerships, sales, distribution, licensing, and more.

                <h2>Advising on National and International Business:</h2>
