# Law-firm-website
Hey everyone so this is my first freelance project,also I'm a newbie and still working on my skills. Constructive criticism is always welcome. And let me know if there is a need for any changes.
The website is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the interactivity and dynamic elements. This combination of technologies allows us to create a website that is not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.
